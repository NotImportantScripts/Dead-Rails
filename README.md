## ðŸ§ª Freshest Spaghetti (Sorted by Commit Date)

### ðŸŒ€ AutoSwingGui.lua *(May 18, 2025)*  
Swings for you, because you have better things to do (like AFK in style).  
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotImportantScripts/Dead-Rails/main/AutoSwingGui.lua"))()
```

---

### ðŸ¦… vfly.lua *(May 17, 2025)*  
DO NOT EXECUTE. Seriously. It wonâ€™t do anything. Trust me.  
```lua
-- Don't even bother.
```

---

### ðŸŽ’ BringItem.lua *(May 16, 2025)*  
Fetches items like youâ€™ve got telekinesis. Works with weirdly named junk too.

```

---

### ðŸ”’ AnticheatBypassr.lua *(May 12, 2025)*

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotImportantScripts/Dead-Rails/main/AnticheatBypassr.lua"))()
```

---

### ðŸŽ›ï¸ BanjoGui.lua *(May 8, 2025)*

```

---

### ðŸ§² TomsHub.lua *(May 8, 2025)*

```

---

### ðŸ•ï¸ TpCamp.lua *(May 8, 2025)*  
Teleports you to the camp. Because walking is for mortals.

```

---

### ðŸ„ TpBarn.lua *(May 8, 2025)*  
Straight to the barn. Yeehaw.

```

---

### ðŸ¤– AllyDrag.lua *(May 8, 2025)*  
**NOT server-side.** Youâ€™ll only be dragging them on your screen. Sad, I know.  
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotImportantScripts/Dead-Rails/main/AllyDrag.lua"))()
```

---

### ðŸ”§ AirWeld.lua *(May 8, 2025)*  
Magically welds stuff. Donâ€™t ask how. It just works.

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotImportantScripts/Dead-Rails/main/AirWeld.lua"))()
```

---

### â˜ ï¸ DONT-EXECUTE-THIS-ISTG.lua *(May 8, 2025)*  
No seriously. DO. NOT. EXECUTE. This script exists purely to destroy you.  
```lua
-- You're still reading? You really want to explode?
```

---

### ðŸŒ NotImportant.html *(May 4, 2025)*  
The one and only totally unnecessary HTML file. Whatâ€™s it doing here? Who knows.
```html
<!-- Definitely not Lua -->
```
