## 🧪 What Is This?

A chaotic collection of Roblox scripts written at 3AM with questionable logic and even worse intentions.  
They work. Usually. Probably. I think.

## 🧠 Join My Totally Normal Servers

Come vibe, share scripts, or just send memes at 4AM:

- [Ringta](https://discord.gg/ringta) — where I pretend to be productive  
- [KarraHub](https://discord.gg/karrahub) — home of probably too many exploiters  
- [LastExploiters](https://discord.gg/PKBSxN7w) — self-explanatory  
- [TomTom Scripts](https://discord.gg/JPFS9zNG) — for people who script and also maybe drive

## ⚠️ Legal-ish Stuff

- Scripts are **obfuscated**. Yes, intentionally. No, I won’t explain them.  
- Use at your own risk. If your Roblox account becomes sentient and leaves you, that’s on you.  
- I script for fun — and officially for **Ringta** and **KarraHub**.

## ❓ Q&A

**Q: Can I get the unobfuscated version?**  
A: Sure, right after I hand over my bank info and social security number.

**Q: Why are the scripts obfuscated?**  
A: Because mystery is fun. Also, because copy-pasters give me hives.

**Q: Do your scripts get me banned?**  
A: Only if you run them while screaming “I’M EXPLOITING!” in global chat.

**Q: Can I DM you on Discord?**  
A: Absolutely. My Discord is `notextrovert12` — whether I answer is between me and my dopamine levels.
