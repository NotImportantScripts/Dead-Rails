# NotImportantScripts

> *Yes, I script for fun. No, you can’t read it — it's obfuscated.*  

A mysterious pile of scripts made for Roblox, crafted just for fun (and maybe a little chaos).  
Use them at your own risk. I don’t bite... but the code might.

## Scripts

### TpCamp  
Teleport and chill.  
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotImportantScripts/Dead-Rails/refs/heads/main/TpCamp"))()
```

---

### BanjoGui  
A GUI that may or may not do something useful.  
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotImportantScripts/Dead-Rails/main/BanjoGui"))()
```

---

### AirWeld  
Welds, but in the air. What more could you want?  
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotImportantScripts/Dead-Rails/refs/heads/main/AirWeld"))()
```
