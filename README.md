# Dead-Rails Scripts – Totally Serious, Definitely Maintained

> 🛑 I officially quit being a dev in the Ringta server. Take these scripts, mock them, cherish them, whatever.

Welcome to the most chaotic collection of Lua spaghetti you've ever seen. Below is a list of every script I ever made for this chaotic mess game called Dead Rails on roblox, sorted with the newest ones at the top. Enjoy the junk.

## 📜 Script List (Most recent at top)

### 🟢 `AutoSwingGui.lua`
Added: May 18, 2025  
A GUI to auto swing. That’s it. You're welcome.

---

### 🟢 `vfly.lua`
Added: May 17, 2025  
Don't execute this. It literally does nothing. Trust me. It just... sits there. Looking pretty.

---

### 🟢 `BringItem.lua`
Added: May 16, 2025  
Brings the specified item(s) to you. You say "come here", it says "how many?".

---

### 🟠 `AnticheatBypassr.lua`
Added: May 12, 2025  
Does exactly what it says. Bypasses anti-cheat... probably. If you get banned, you didn't read the fine print.

---

### 🔴 `DONT-EXECUTE-THIS-ISTG.lua`
Added: May 12, 2025  
No, seriously, **don’t execute this**. I’m warning you. This exists purely as a trap for the curious.

---

### 🎸 `BanjoGui.lua`
Added: May 8, 2025  
A GUI... for banjos. Sounds dumb? That’s because it is. But it works.

---

### 🧲 `TpBarn.lua`
Added: May 8, 2025  
Teleport to the barn. Why walk when you can instantly regret being there?

---

### 🧭 `TpCamp.lua`
Added: May 8, 2025  
Teleport to the camp. Roasting marshmallows not included.

---

### 💀 `TomsHub.lua`
Added: May 8, 2025  
My weird little hub of horrors. Contains all the stuff I forgot to document.

---

### 🕊️ `AllyDrag.lua`
Added: May 8, 2025  
Drags allies. BUT — and this is important — **it's not server-side.** Don’t act shocked when it desyncs or explodes.

---

### 🔧 `AirWeld.lua`
Added: May 8, 2025  
Some Frankenstein weld system I made in 3 AM panic. No guarantees it’ll weld anything useful.

---

### 🖼️ `NotImportant.html`
Added: May 4, 2025  
Literally a website about how not important I am. Peak sarcasm. Peak ego. No CSS tho.

---

## 🤡 Bonus

**README.md** — the thing you're reading right now. oh probably noones reads this lol.

---

## 💬 Final Note

I’m done being a dev in the Ringta server. I'm a dev in KarraHub and Doggo's Hub now. These scripts are here for laughs, hacks, and possibly catastrophic errors.  
Use with caution. Or don't. I'm not your dad.
